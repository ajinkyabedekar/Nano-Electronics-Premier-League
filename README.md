Title: Can Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) be used for targeted drug delivery for cancer therapies?

For the start, critical investigation:

a. Carbon to Carbon Nano Tubes, What you understand from this?

b. What are CNTs and what are their Properties?

c. At present CNTs are used for what applications?

d. What is chemotherapy and what are its disadvantages?

e. What are physicochemical properties of CNTs?

f. What is drug delivery and how CNTs are used for drug delivery?

g. What is drug administration?

h. What is drug absorption?

i. What is drug transportation?

j. Can similar targeted drug delivery be used for dissolving clots in brain? If so how?

k. How safe these targeted drug delivery systems?
